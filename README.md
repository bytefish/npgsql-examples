# npgsql-examples #

This is a repository for PostgreSQL and Npgsql samples.

## notify-listen ##

Shows how to use the `NOTIFY` and `LISTEN` features with Npgsql.

### Start the PostgreSQL database ###
 
Start by switching to `notify-listen/docker` and run:

```
docker compose up
```

It starts a local PostgreSQL 16 instance listening `localhost:5432` using username `postgres` and password `password`.

### Start the .NET Application ###

Start the .NET application, the Connection String (given in the `appsettings.json`) already points to the local Postgres instance.

### Using psql to update the data ###

We switch over to a Terminal and start `psql` to update some data:

```
> psql -h localhost -U postgres -W
Password:

psql (15.2, server 16.6 (Debian 16.6-1.pgdg120+1))
WARNING: psql major version 15, server major version 16.
         Some psql features might not work.
WARNING: Console code page (437) differs from Windows code page (1252)

postgres=# SELECT * FROM gitclub.repository;
 repository_id |      name      | organization_id | last_edited_by
---------------+----------------+-----------------+----------------
             1 | Tooling        |               1 |              1
             2 | Specifications |               1 |              1

postgres=# UPDATE gitclub.repository SET name = 'New Tooling' WHERE repository_id = 1;
UPDATE 1
```

### Enjoying the received Notification ###

And in the Console we will see the incoming notification generated by the PostgreSQL `NOTIFY` command:

```
dbug: Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.Internal.Host[2]
      Hosting started

      PostgresNotification (PID = 137, Channel = core_db_event, Payload = {"timestamp" : "2025-01-25T08:38:47.781178+00:00", "row_version" : "752", "operation" : "UPDATE", "schema" : "gitclub", "table" : "repository", "payload" : {"repository_id":1,"name":"New Tooling","organization_id":1,"last_edited_by":1}}
